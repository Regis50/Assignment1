    <p> Fish are extremely diverse animals living in a variety of habitats ranging from coral reefs
         and kelp forests to rivers, streams, and the open ocean. Most fish can be categorized into one of two primary groups:
          bony fish (Osteichthyes) and cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes). The skeleton of bony fish is made of bones, while 
          that of cartilaginous fish is made of cartilage. Cartilaginous fish include sharks, skates, and rays
