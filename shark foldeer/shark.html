    <P>Sharks are fast-swimming fishes that have a skeleton made of cartilage instead of bone. 
        (Cartilage is an elastic tissue that is created before bone begins to form.)
         They are related to rays. Sharks are among the oldest animals on Earth. 
         The first sharks lived more than 300 million years ago. Today there are more than 300 species, or types, of shark
